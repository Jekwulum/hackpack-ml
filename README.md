# hackpack-ml

Make and deploy ML hacks with PyTorch

Training and iterating on ML models during hackathons poses challenges due to the limited time of the event. 
We hope to make this process easier with a hackpack!

### Features

The goal of this hackpack is to make iterating on your models easy while also providing for quick integration into apps.

We include:
1. Jupyter notebooks for different types of tasks and prebuilt models:
    * Natural Language
        *  
    * Computer Vision
    * Structured/Tabular data
    * Generative Models
    * Adding your own datasets
    * Export models into a callable API or a CoreML model
 
## Getting Started
### Installing
```
!pip3 install torchvision
```
## Deployment
### Google Colab
