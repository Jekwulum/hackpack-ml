# hackpack-ml

Make and deploy ML hacks in PyTorch.

Training and iterating on ML models during hackathons poses challenges due to the limited time of the event. 
We hope to make this process easier with a hackpack!

### Features

The goal of this hackpack is to make iterating on your models easy while also providing for quick integration into apps.

We include:
1. Jupyter notebooks for different types of tasks and prebuilt models:
    * Image classification (DenseNet)
    * Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) *
    * Regression *
    * Variational Autoencoder *
    * Integrating datasets into PyTorch *
    
2. A Flask server per model to deploy as an API.

## Getting Started

This hackpack assumes some prior understanding of Python. Understanding of Deep Learning techniques is greatly beneficial but not required. If you are interested in learning, [Deep Learning by Goodfellow et al.](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) is a good starting point.
### Installing
```
!pip3 install torchvision
```
## Deployment
### Google Colab

# About HackPacks ðŸŒ²

HackPacks are built by the [TreeHacks](https://www.treehacks.com/) team to help hackers build great projects at our hackathon that happens every February at Stanford. We believe that everyone of every skill level can learn to make awesome things, and this is one way we help facilitate hacker culture. We open source our hackpacks (along with our internal tech) so everyone can learn from and use them! Feel free to use these at your own hackathons, workshops, and anything else that promotes building :) 

If you're interested in attending TreeHacks, you can apply on our [website](https://www.treehacks.com/) during the application period.

You can follow us here on [GitHub](https://github.com/treehacks) to see all the open source work we do (we love issues, contributions, and feedback of any kind!), and on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/treehacks), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hackwithtrees), and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/hackwithtrees) to see general updates from TreeHacks.
